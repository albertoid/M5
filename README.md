## Observations

What I did was cleaning ans integrating the database in order to be able to apply the Machine Learning methods and check the results. Is important to say that the volume of data is big, and in a simple computer with 4 cores and 8Gb in RAM this can spend a lot of time of processing, speccially if you "play" with hyperparameters in methods like xgboost.
